Welcome to your interactive pricing model.

Use the sidebar on the left to:
- **💸 Quote:** Generate quotes for any destination state and MSRP.
- **🛠️ Admin:** Upload new shipment data, recalibrate the model, and publish new versions.

Each recalibration automatically learns the latest cost behavior across states,
keeps 95% of shipments in the 10–40% profit window, and centers on your 18% target.
